"description": "I'm Braian, a performing artist from Argentina specializing in aerial acrobatics and dance.\n\nMy work blends strength, body control, and artistic expression to create intense visual experiences.\n\nI've performed on stages across Argentina and Turkey—from circuses and theaters to international shows—always pushing my art to the limit. Each performance is my way of exploring new languages through the body, turning every movement into a living story.\n\nBecause being in motion is not just a physical state—it's the way I live my evolution as an artist.",
